I haven't really done anything with my GitHub pages site, except setup Octopress and publish one blog post. Every time I've wanted to add a new entry I've got distracted fucking with Octopress and Ruby and Jekyll and a bunch of other stuff I don't care to learn, and ended up losing my motivation.

This time it happened again, and I've decided to just get rid of Octopress and Jekyll entirely and go back to raw HTML. It won't be the trendiest, prettiest website on the internet, but at least I know how to use it, and it won't have random shit breaking requiring an hour of tinkering to figure out which of a million Ruby gems is broken or not installed.
