            I recently wrote a small library, called [gpxtools](https://github.com/jl2/gpxtools),
            for processing [GPX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_Exchange_Format) track files in
            Common Lisp.

            It doesn't have many features yet, but right now it can read a GPX file and compute
            elevation gain, elevation loss, and the total distance of all the tracks in the file.

            Here is a sample usage from the REPL:

            <code>
              * (ql:quickload 'gpxtools)
              To load "gpxtools":
              Load 1 ASDF system:
              gpxtools
              ; Loading "gpxtools"
              .....
              (GPXTOOLS)
              * (defparameter *gpx*
              (gpxtools:read-gpx "/Users/jeremiah/gpx_tracks/precarious_climb.gpx"))
              Processing track: ACTIVE LOG
              *GPX*
              * (gpxtools:summarize *gpx*)
              Total elevation gain: 3567.271946242661d0 feet
              Total elevation loss: -3538.885209324304d0 feet
              Total elevation loss: 6.437161570619994d0 miles
              NIL
              *
            </code>

            So far the most challenging part of the project was the calculation of distances given
            points in latitude and longitude.  Doing so requires converting the coordinates to the
            [Universal Transverse
            Mercator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system)
            (UTM) coordinate system which uses meters, and then calculating the distance.

            I wasn't able to find a library to do the conversion for me, so I [wrote my
            own](https://github.com/jl2/utm), and requested it be added to QuickLisp.  It looks like
            everything went well, and it should be in the next release.

            I'm planning to add more features to the gpxtools library, and to clean up the code in a
            few spots.

            One thing I want to do is add generic traversal code and use it to simplify functions like
            distance, elevation-gain, and elevation-loss that iterate over the entire GPX data
            structure.

            Another thing I want to add is the ability to split tracks at a certain location and
            selectively write the results back to one or more files.  I'll often start my GPS at the
            beginning of a hike, but forget to turn off the GPS when I finish hiking and drive away.
            The result is a GPX track with 10 miles of hiking and 50 miles of driving.  I may even try
            to do the cut automatically, ending the track when it gets back to (or reasonably close
            to) the origin, and splitting the drive out into a second track automatically.
